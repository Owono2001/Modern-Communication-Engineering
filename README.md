For this assignment, I developed an Internet of Things (IoT) network using sensors, LowPAN Gateway, routers, and wired nodes to simulate data collection and transmission. The project was centered around designing a network to sense physical phenomena such as light, heat, temperature, and pressure using connected sensors. The LowPAN Gateway played a crucial role in bridging the internal sensor network with the external Internet infrastructure, following the IPv6 addressing system.

The tasks involved building the network, organizing the configuration settings, and performing simulations to track how IP addresses change from source to destination as data moves through the network. Various performance metrics such as Network Metrics, Link Metrics, Application Metrics, and Protocol Metrics were examined to evaluate the efficiency and reliability of the network. The simulation results were represented graphically, and I provided analysis and comments on the performance.

This project demonstrates the integration of physical systems into computer-based infrastructures, which highlights the potential of IoT for improved efficiency and reliability in infrastructure systems.
